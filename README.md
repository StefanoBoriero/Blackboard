### Application Description
Blackboard is an Android application that helps groups of people to manage housework.  
Users that share an house environment can create a shared list of tasks to do: each housemate can either add a new item or elect 
himself in charge of completing an existing one. A user can later access the list of tasks he reserved for himself to do 
in a separate private list, and tag an item as completed or resign from the duty: in the latter case the item will appear 
back in the shared list.  
The user can also unlock achievements related to the usage of the application in order to promote the dedication to housework,
and access them through the private profile section.

### Device requirements
In order to run properly, the device should run Android 5.0 or higher
